<p>In this game that my partner and I created, the goal is to defeat the enemines and win. The user,or player, is able
to choose between a male and female character. Also the player can select the difficulty level
of the game. The player is able to move the character by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard 
and pressing the space bar to shoot at the enemies. The player must be careful as the character does 
health and can lose the game if their health is brought to zero by the enemy. Once the first enemy 
is defeated, the player will encounter the final boss which is Kim Jung Un. If the player defeats Kim, 
the player wins the game.</p> 
<p>From this project, I learned how to code sprites and backdrops. In this process, I learned some algorithms that allowed the sprites 
in my game to move, fire their weapon, and have health. For the backdrops, I was able to create sprites that actted like buttons 
so the player can press them to move to the next backdrop. Also the backdrops would change when the player clicks on the sprites (characters 
and selecting difficulty level) and when the enemy is defeated or if the player loses. Some abstractions that I created for the game 
was allowing the charcters to move when the player presses the arrow keys and coding the enemies to move and shoot at the player. </p>

<p>From this project, I learned how to code an image with a different color from the original. In the process, I learned a new code that takes an image as 
an input, modifies it using the PIL, and saves the new image under a new name I chose. To figure out how to come up with the code, I used
the PIL Tutorial my teacher posted on his page to help me modify the image i chose. For version control, I played around with the functions 
within the code to see what the result would be and the first time I modified the image to be black and white. After that I added another 
image of superman but also changed the function that made the image black and white to making it green and blue. This code, as seen at the bottom
would produce two images, the origianl and the modified one. This is another code I learned in using the programmig language called python which has
been quite interesting.</p>
