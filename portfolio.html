<p>In this game that my partner and I created, the goal is to defeat the enemines and win. The user,or player, is able
to choose between a male and female character. Also the player can select the difficulty level
of the game. The player is able to move the character by pressing the arrow keys on the keyboard 
and pressing the space bar to shoot at the enemies. The player must be careful as the character does 
health and can lose the game if their health is brought to zero by the enemy. Once the first enemy 
is defeated, the player will encounter the final boss which is Kim Jung Un. If the player defeats Kim, 
the player wins the game.</p> 
<p>From this project, I learned how to code sprites and backdrops. In this process, I learned some algorithms that allowed the sprites 
in my game to move, fire their weapon, and have health. For the backdrops, I was able to create sprites that actted like buttons 
so the player can press them to move to the next backdrop. Also the backdrops would change when the player clicks on the sprites (characters 
and selecting difficulty level) and when the enemy is defeated or if the player loses. Some abstractions that I created for the game 
was allowing the charcters to move when the player presses the arrow keys and coding the enemies to move and shoot at the player. </p>
<h1>This is my App Inventor Game</h1>

<p>In this game that my partner and I created, the mission is to survive as long as you can. The user is able to control the character 
by pressing on the screen to make them go up. This allows the character to dodge the swords that are in its way; otherwise, the user will hit 
one of the swords and lose. This game is based off of the popular game back in 2013, Flappy Bird. </p>
<p>This project was similar to scratch on the codes that could be used. The difficult part was trying to learn how these codes were to be used. 
Once I learned how to use the codes provided by AppInventor, it was much easier to create the game my partner and I wanted. I learned how to
code sprites and the screen for a device that would be used to run the app. For the sprites, my partner I programmed the character that is going to be 
used by the user so that the game works as its suppossed to. Also my partner and I programmed the swords to change different sizes and move towards the 
left side of the screen so that it would look as though the screen is moving. Once this was completed, we programmed the screens so that the game 
could actually be played. We added a canvas so the screen could be touched by the user, a timer for the swords so that they would move and change 
as they move towards the left side of the screen. Once all of this was put together, our game functioned quite well with some minor issues. We fixed 
those and actually got our game to work as it should and we were able to change numbers in the codes so that the game could move at a faster pace to 
see how much difficult it can be when playing. </p>
<h1>This is my Python Fiction Story</h1>

<center><img src="images/PythonStory3.PNG" height="150"></center>
<p>In this project, my partners and I created a story on python. The point of this story was for the user to type in inputs and find out what happens next. 
In our story, we had fiction story about a kid who found a stone and he gets powers from it. From their the kid can choose to be good or bad and from there 
their were more choices for the user to control the kid's adventure or life perhaps.</p>
<p>From this project, I learned how to define codes, write if and else statements, and print choices and answers to what the user chooses to input. With this,
our story was functional as we tested it out every time we finished defining a new path and writing statements for the kid's adventure. This project was quite 
easy as it was based on statements and not much else like Scratch or Appinventor.</p>
<h1>This is my Python Game Project</h1>

<img src="images/Python Game 4.PNG" height="450">
<p>In this project, my partner and I produced a game on python. This game is rather simple as everyone knows the game rock, paper, scissors, but this game we 
produced adds two more choices to the original game which is lizard and spock. Since this game is on python, the user has to input the choices of rock, paper, 
scissors, lizard, or spock into the program. The user competes with the computer player that has the same choices and is programed to randomly choose between rock,
paper, scissors, lizard, or spock. Depending on what the user picks, the computer player chooses randomly so it's anyones game, similar to real life.</p>
<p>From this project, I learned how to code with numbers and strings as this is how the program functions correctly. The computer player has its own function which
allows it to randomly choose from the five choices as the numbers in the function are used by the program to tell the user what the computer player has chosen and who
has won the game. For the user, a similar function was created so that when the user inputs a string, the program sees it as a number now and is subtracted with the computer player's
number to determine who is the winner of the game.

<h1>This is my Image Modifier Task</h1>

<img src="images/ImageModifyCode.PNG" height="350">
<p>In this project, my partner and I grabbed an image off of google, the Superman image seem above, and we changed the color of it using python. 
This was possible by modifying the color values known as red, green , and blue on the image. </p>
<p>From this project, I learned how to code an image with a different color from the original. In the process, I learned a new code that takes an image as 
an input, modifies it using the PIL, and saves the new image under a new name I chose. To figure out how to come up with the code, I used
the PIL Tutorial my teacher posted on his page to help me modify the image I chose. For version control, I played around with the functions 
within the code to see what the result would be and the first time I modified the image to be black and white. After that I added another 
image of superman but also changed the function that made the image black and white to making it green and blue. This code, as seen at the bottom
would produce two images, the origianl and the modified one. This is another code I learned in using the programmig language called python which has
been quite interesting.</p>
<h1>This is my Malware Presentation</h1>
<center><img src="images/Malware.PNG" height="275"></center>
<p>From this presentation, I learned that ZeroAccess is a malware that opens a backdoor to the Command and Control Server of a user's computer.
ZeroAccess is disguised as fake messages, websites, or programs that is unknowingly downloaded by the user. Once the hacker has access to the compromised
computer, the hacker adds the compromised computer to a wider botnet that is used by hackers to make money through pay-per-click advertising and 
bitcoin mining. The best advice to stay away from this is to always be careful when surfing the web, stay away from suspicious websites, and maintain
an updated, quality antivirus program and your computer. For the overall malware learning process, I learned that you have to be careful what you do on 
the internet, looking at fake links sent to your email, updating your computer's security when given, and not downloading shading things. </p>
<h1>This is my Big Data Presentation</h1>
<center><img src="images/Big Data.PNG" height="275"></center>
<p>From this presentation, I learned that Facial Recognition is big data due to the volume and variety that it deals with. This would be considering
that there is over 7 billion people on the planet as well as the many different physical characteristics. Also to consider is the different angling views,
lighting, the amount of faces on a screen, and more. One benefit to society would be fighting crime as we will be able to identify the criminal
and one harm to society would be invasion of privacy as people would not like the fact that they are being recorded without their permission. Facial Recognition
produces data as a camera takes the physical characteristics of a person's face and saves that data into a database that could be used for later purposes.
A concern related to the privacy of data being used by Facial Recognition is that some people do not want their data to be compromised or used for 
marketing purposes. 
<h1>This is my Data Analysis</h1>
<center><img src="images/Data Analysis.PNG" height="275"></center>
<p>In this project, my partner and I looked up raw data on the leading causes of death in the United States. We narrowed it down to homicides in the top ten states in 
the year 2000. This was quite an easy process as this was just looking for the raw data that has been given from the government. </p>
<p>From this project, I learned how to code a bar graph with the raw data we found from the leading causes of death in the United States. We coded this on 
python and my partner and I helped each other as well as looking up some codes to help us with the bar graph coding. Once we had all the numbers inputted into the 
code that was used for the bar graph, the program created a nice bar graph for us to use. </p>
<h1>This is my Simulation Modification</h1>
<center><img src="images/Simulation Img.PNG" height="275"></center>
<p>In this project, my partner and I looked at a simulation that our teacher told us to look at. This simulation was about sheep and wolfs and a grass food supply. 
When we played the simulation, two outcomes would happen, the sheep would be the dominant species and the wolfs disappeared or the wolfs would eat all of the sheep and then eat each 
other.  </p>
<p>From this project, I learned how to modify the simulation with the already given variables that could be modified so that the simulation can either be more realistic or less 
realistic. This is based on changing the grass food supply or changing the rate at which the sheep or wolfs reproduce. Also he initial amount of sheep and wolfs can be increased or decreased. 
With this the simulation can play continuously with the variables at a right number or the sheep can overpopulate or the wolfs can eat each other again. </p>
